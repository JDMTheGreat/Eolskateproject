Chromebook conversion to Gallium

Step 1: 
1. Enable Developer Mode on the Chromebook
       This is necessary to gain access to the full system to install GalliumOS.
2. Turn off the Chromebook.
3. Enter Recovery Mode:
    a. Press and hold the Esc + Refresh keys, then press the Power button.
    b. Keep holding the Esc + Refresh keys until you see a recovery screen.
4. Enable Developer Mode:
    a. On the recovery screen, press Ctrl + D to enable Developer Mode.
    b. You will see a warning message about data loss. Press Enter to continue.
5. The Chromebook will reboot and start transitioning to Developer Mode, which may take several minutes. This process will wipe all local data.
 - Note: When Developer Mode is enabled, the Chromebook will prompt you to press Ctrl + D at every boot to proceed. You can skip this warning once GalliumOS is installed.

Step 2: 
1. Flash the Chromebook's BIOS (if required)
    a. Some Chromebooks require a custom BIOS to install a Linux distribution, as ChromeOS uses a specialized firmware. For these devices, you’ll need to replace the stock ChromeOS firmware with one compatible with GalliumOS.
    b. Visit MrChromebox’s website to get the required BIOS image for your specific model:
    c. Go to MrChromebox's Firmware Project for detailed instructions and downloads.
2. Enable Write Protection (if required):
    a. Most newer Chromebooks have write protection on the firmware to prevent changes. You’ll need to physically remove a screw or jumper on the device's motherboard to disable this protection. Check MrChromebox’s site for specific instructions for your Chromebook model.
3. Flash the BIOS:
    a. After disabling write protection, you’ll use MrChromebox's tools to flash the custom firmware.
    Open Crosh (Ctrl + Alt + T) and type the following command:
    `bash`
    `shell` 
    `sudo crossystem dev_boot_usb=1 dev_boot_legacy=1`

4. Follow the instructions on the MrChromebox website to download and install the firmware using a USB drive or a live Linux environment.

Step 3: 
1. Create a Bootable USB Drive for GalliumOS
    a. Download GalliumOS:
    b. Go to GalliumOS Download Page and choose the correct version for your Chromebook model.
    c. Create a Bootable USB Drive:
    d.Use a tool like Etcher or Rufus to create a bootable USB stick with the GalliumOS ISO image. Make sure the USB drive has at least 4GB of space.
2. On your computer, open Etcher, select the GalliumOS ISO, and choose the USB drive. Then click Flash! to create the bootable USB drive.

Step 4: 
1. Boot from USB and Install GalliumOS
    a. Plug the Bootable USB Drive into the Chromebook.
2. Enter Recovery Mode:
    a. Turn off the Chromebook, then turn it back on while holding Esc + Refresh + Power.
     - This should take you to a recovery screen.
3. Boot from USB:
 - If you have flashed the BIOS to allow booting from USB, the Chromebook should automatically detect the USB drive as a bootable option.
 - If not, press Ctrl + L when the screen shows the recovery message. This should boot the Chromebook from the USB drive.
4. Start the GalliumOS Installation:
 - Once GalliumOS boots from the USB drive, you'll see the GalliumOS desktop.
5. Double-click the Install GalliumOS icon to start the installation process.
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to install GalliumOS on the Chromebook.
 - Choose the appropriate language, time zone, and installation options. Note: This will wipe ChromeOS completely and install GalliumOS.

Step 5: 
1. Complete the Installation and Set Up GalliumOS
2. Finalize the Installation:
3. Once the installation is complete, the Chromebook will prompt you to reboot. Remove the USB drive before rebooting.
4. First Boot of GalliumOS:
 - On the first boot, GalliumOS will take a few minutes to finalize setup. Once it’s done, you’ll be able to log in and start using GalliumOS.
 - You’ll see the familiar Xfce desktop environment, similar to other lightweight Linux distros.
5. Update and Configure:
 - Once logged in, update the system by opening a Terminal and running:
`bash`
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt upgrade`

6. Configure your Wi-Fi, install any additional software, and set up your user accounts as needed.

Step 6: 
1. Optional - Set Up a Guest Account or Guest Session
    a. If you want to configure a Guest Mode or resettable Guest Session for multiple users:
 - Enable Guest Session:
    b. Open the Terminal and run:
`bash`
`sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`

2. Add the following lines under the [Seat:*] section:
`Copy code`
`allow-guest=true`
`guest-session=true`

3. Save and exit (Ctrl + O, then Ctrl + X), then restart the system.
4. Test the Guest Session:
 - Log out of your account, and you should see a “Guest Session” option on the login screen.
