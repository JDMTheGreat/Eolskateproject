Chromebook Troubleshooting
11/16/24

Issue: Chromebooks 1 & 2 could not connect to the internet.

Initial possible cause: NIC issues that could require a physical repair

Methodology:
 I logged into Chromebook 1 and found only guest profile accessible. Chromebook ahs city log-ins but no discernible “managed by messages”
    Guest could not connect to the internet over public wifi unable to establish a connection and the captive portal returned a 204 error
    Attempted connectivity over a hotspot found the Chromebook was capable of accessing the internet
    Issue suspected the same for both devices
    I tried an unsecured HTTP connection which forced a redirect to the portal
Able to accept public wifi terms and connect to the internet issue resolved on both devices

Future concerns:
    Devices are unmanaged so no regular checking of security settings.
    Sessions will eventually time out and Guest profiles may return to not having connectivity over the public wifi will require a manual forcing of going to the captive portal to accept terms again
    No access to admin logins to manage devices

Options for going forward:
    1. Leave devices as is and leave instructions for a manual reconnect process
        Devices will be vulnerable and will require regular manual reconnection processes to the public wifi
        Devices are ready to go today
    2. Convert to Cloud terminals 
        Devices will need extra work to convert to simple terminals that can only do basic tasks with limited connectivity
        Devices remain vulnerable due to EOL issues and not getting updates
    3. Reimage devices with Gallium OS
        A lightweight OS designed for Chromebooks will enable all security functions due to it being an Open source OS that constantly receives updates
        Will require more downtime for clearing and reformatting device drives
        Looks feels and works a lot like Chrome OS
    4. Recycle and replace devices
        Similar books are 130-230$ per device
        current models should be good for years to come
